Meal Plan App
A meal planning application developed using Kotlin for Android. This app helps users plan their meals, track ingredients, and store recipes for future use. It leverages Room Database for local storage and integrates Moshi for JSON parsing and RecyclerView for displaying meal data.

What I Learned
App Structure
Data Management
Dao Interfaces: Interact with local data using Data Access Objects (DAOs).
API Integration: Fetch cloud data via Service interfaces.
Repository Classes: Utilize repositories to manage data interactions between DAOs and service interfaces.
Data Classes: Model local and cloud data using Kotlin data classes.
Connecting Data to UI
Adapters & Recycler Views: Use adapters to populate and modify Recycler Views.
ViewModel Classes: Connect repositories to data via ViewModels.
Fragments: Use fragments to manage UI and data interactions, attaching functionality to events such as button clicks and data updates.
User Interface
Layouts & Fragments: Design a main layout with multiple dynamic fragments for different sections of the app.
Icons & Images: Incorporate images and icons to enhance UI appearance.
Menu Creation: Design a navigation menu for ease of access.
Navigation & Data Passing: Implement navigation between fragments with the ability to pass data between them.
UI Customization: Use preset string and color resources to maintain consistency across the app.
Key Android Development Concepts
Room Database: Store and manage meal data locally.
Moshi JSON Parsing: Parse JSON data received from APIs.
RecyclerView: Display dynamic lists of meals, recipes, and ingredients.
LiveData & MutableLiveData: Observe and update the UI based on changes in data.
Jetpack Navigation: Implement efficient and intuitive navigation between fragments.
